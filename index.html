<h1>Grocery Store System Proposal </h1>
<p>28 October 2022 Group Members: Daniel Eric Phangandy, Philipus Adriel Tandra</p>
<div>
    We plan to create a store program that works like a sales system containing items with their own individual code and id and stock numbers. We want to try and differentiate 
    ourselves from others by connecting Python to an existing SQL database connector and other such frameworks that can integrate with Python such as tkinter or Django. It can 
    be hard to tell whether a business is doing well or not as a result of the vast array of items that they have, so we are looking into visualizers to aid in the creation of 
    our databases using Python. There is also the possibility of us using other libraries such as pandas to turn the databases into a readable csv file, with this we are able
    to make a General User Interface that can go alongside our SQL Database as well as create a way for us to manipulate the databases in a different away than just opening the
    SQL files directly from the server.
